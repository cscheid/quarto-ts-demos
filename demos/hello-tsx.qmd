title: Hello, TSX
---

Quarto also offers support for TSX syntax. Note that we do _not_ use React ourselves; we simply support the syntax and construct the DOM elements directly. That, together with OJS reactivity, gets you a long way towards pleasant DOM manipulation.

```{ojs}
import { buildList, buildCircles } from "./hello-tsx.tsx"

buildList([1, 2, 3])
buildCircles([10, 15, 20])
```

Caveats:

- Quarto currently only supports `tsx`, and not `jsx`.
- We construct DOM elements through standard calls to `createElement`. There's Observable's reactivity but no additional TSX runtime support.
- We intend to support this syntax fully but the implementation is currently experimental.
